                <p>Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954) was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>Born in Maida Vale, London, he displayed exceptional mathematical ability from a young age. He went on to attend King's College, Cambridge where he was elected to a fellowship in recognition of his research in probability theory. He later completed a Ph.D in mathematical logic at Princeton University in 1938. </p>
                <p>He died from cyanide poisoning at the age of 41. Be it by assasination from the sercret service, suicide, or accidental inhalation during an experiment in his home laboratory, the precise nature of his death has never been resolved. </p>
                <p>The movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game" target="_blank">"The Imitation Game"</a> starring Benedict Cumberbatch was inspired by his life and work as a cryptanalyst during WWII.</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>Turing made significant contributions to various fields, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Formulating the concept of the Turing machine, a fundamental model of computation</li>
            <li>Playing a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II</li>
            <li>Developing the Turing Test to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior</li>
            <li>Writing the first ever programming manual, his programming system was used to create the first ever marketable electronic computer, the Ferranti Mark I</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Alan Turing's work laid the foundation for modern computer science, and his legacy continues to impact various fields. Despite his significant contributions, sometimes reffered to as the "father of computer science", he faced persecution due to his homosexuality, which was then illegal. He was posthumously pardoned in 2013.</p>
